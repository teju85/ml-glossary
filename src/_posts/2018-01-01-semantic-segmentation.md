Semantic segmentation is a segmentation problem where one has to identify
all category of objects.

They need not necessarily classify all instances of the same category, though.
Refer to [instance segmentation]({{ site.baseurl}}/{% post_url 2018-01-01-instance-segmentation %})
for more details on this. Example: chairs, table, people, etc.
