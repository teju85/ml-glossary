LU decomposition is a square matrix factorization technique.

For a given square matrix M, there exists a decomposition of the form:
$$ M = L . U $$
* M = the input matrix of dimension n x n.
* L = lower triangular matrix
* U = upper triangular matrix

LU-decomp is a way of gaussian elimination, which is used to solve a system of
linear equations.

There is a variant of LU-decomp with partial pivoting, of the form:
$$ P . A = L . U $$
where P is a permutation of rows. This approach, in practice, is more numerically
stable.
