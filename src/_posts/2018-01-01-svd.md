SVD is a matrix factorization technique.

For a given matrix, there exists a decomposition of it which can be written as
follows:
$$ M = U . \Sigma . V^* $$
* M = the input matrix of dimension m x n.
* U = m x m unitary matrix
* $$\Sigma$$ = m x n diagonal matrix
* V = n x n unitary matrix
* V* = conjugate transpose of V

Basic idea behind SVD is that the transformation operation performed by a matrix
M can be viewed as a sequence of the following transformations:
1. V* represents the rotation operation applied onto to a unit hypersphere.
2. $$\Sigma$$ then represents the scaling across the co-ordinate axes.
3. U represents another rotation after scaling operation.

SVD is most often used in finding eigen values and vectors of the matrix. For
example: columns of V are eigenvectors of $$M^*.M$$. columns of U are eigenvectors
of $$M.M^*$$ and non-zero elements of $$\Sigma$$ are sqrt of their eigen values.
