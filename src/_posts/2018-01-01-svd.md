SVD is a matrix factorization technique.

For a given matrix, there exists a decomposition of it which can be written as
follows:
$$ M = U . \Sigma . V^* $$
* M = the input matrix of dimension m x n.
* U = m x m unitary matrix
* $$\Sigma$$ = m x n diagonal matrix
* V = n x n unitary matrix
* V* = conjugate transpose of V

SVD is most often used in finding eigen values and vectors of the matrix.
