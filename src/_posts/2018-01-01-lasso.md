Lasso is a regression analysis technique to perform both variable selection as
well as model regularization.

Lasso tries to fit a linear model as follows:
$$ y' = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^N x_i . \beta_i $$
Where:
* N = input dimensionality
* $$ x_i $$ = input variables i = 1 ... N
* $$ \beta_i $$ = model parameters i = 0 ... N
* $$y'$$ = the output

Criterion used to find model paramters is minimizing
$$ \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^M (y_j - y'_j)^2 $$ subject to
$$ \sum_{i=0}^N |\beta_i| \leq s $$
Where:
* M = number of input samples
* s = a hyper-parameter to control regularization, which is often derived
  through cross-validation
