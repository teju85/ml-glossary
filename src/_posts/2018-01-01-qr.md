QR decomposition is a square matrix factorization technique.

For a given matrix A, there exists a decomposition of the form:
$$ A = Q . R $$
* A = the input matrix of dimension n x n.
* Q = unitary matrix
* R = upper triangular matrix

QR-decomp is used to solve a system of linear equations and also used to find
eigenvalues in the QR algorithm
