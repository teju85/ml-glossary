Hyper-parameters are the parameters that define the model itself and how it
is learnt from data.

These are the parameters that:
* cannot be learnt during the training process
* define the model complexity
* define the learning process
For example: learning algorithm, learning-rate, number of layers in a neural
net, etc.

Thus, one needs to perform a search in the hyper-parameter space in order to
discover the best performing model.
