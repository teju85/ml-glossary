Statistical technique to convert a set of (possibly) correlated inputs into a
set of uncorrelated variables.

These uncorrelated variables are also called as _principal components_. PCA is
performed by finding out eigen values and vectors of the covariance matrix of
the input data.

PCA is also used as one of the dimensionality reduction techniques. This is done
by sorting the eigen values in the descending order and only keeping the _top-k_
eigen values and vectors. Where _k_ is derived based on the amount of loss that
is acceptable due to removal of the remaining dimensions.
