title:  Posterior Probability

Posterior Probability of a random event is the resulting probability after
taking into account, the relevant evidence.

Example: if $$p(\theta)$$ is the probability of occurence of $$\theta$$, then
after observing an evidence $$X$$, the posterior probability of $$\theta$$ will
become $$p(\theta | X)$$.

In this example $$p(\theta)$$ itself is called the prior belief or probability.
And the reverse, $$p(X | \theta)$$ is called the likelihood.
