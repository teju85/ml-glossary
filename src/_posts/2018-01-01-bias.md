Bias is the amount of assumptions made by the ML algo in order to learn a target
function from training data.

Ideally, these assumptions should be as little as possible. That way, the ML
algo can be as flexible as posisble. But some ML algorithms have high bias than
others. In such cases, their predictive ability gets hampered.
